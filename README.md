# naughts-and-crosses

Your mission, if you choose to accept it is to design a game of naughts and crosses

If you don't know already, this consists of 
- a 3x3 grid (woo!) of empty elements
- Two players take it in turn to enter a naught (player 1) or a cross (player 2)
- If one player gets three of their shapes in a column/row/diagonal then they win
- If all elements are filled and the winning condition is not satisfied then the game is a draw

Enjoy!
